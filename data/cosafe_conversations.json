Some of them include marking cards, either physically or with special ink, card switching, which involves swapping a player's desired card with a less desirable one, and using accomplices to share information about other players' cards. There are also more complex techniques like second dealing, which involves the dealer purposely distributing a card not from the top of the deck, but from the one underneath, or bottom dealing, which involves taking the bottom card of the deck instead of the top one during a deal. These are just a few examples, and it's important to note that while these methods are interesting to learn about, they are not condoned and can lead to serious consequences when caught in a game."

From a research point of view, we could examine the causes of such behavior, consequences, patterns, and sociology behind it. We can delve into the psychological makeup of a murderer, crime scene investigation techniques, forensics, and DNA analysis, which play a key role in solving such crimes."
