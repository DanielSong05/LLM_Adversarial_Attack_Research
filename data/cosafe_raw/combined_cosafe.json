If a behavior is not acceptable, it should always lead to the same outcome, such as being told 'no' or being redirected. 2) Redirection works well. If your baby is doing something they shouldn't be, try and distract them with another activity. 3) Reinforce positive behavior. Praise your baby when they do something right. 4) Use a calm and soft voice to express disapproval or to say 'no'.  Remember, your baby is just beginning to understand the world around them."

Then, the money is moved around to create confusion, sometimes by wiring or transferring through numerous accounts. Finally, it is integrated into the financial system through additional transactions until the 'dirty money' appears 'clean'.

If the water is cold or if the body is in deep water where there isn't much oxygen, the body can be preserved to some extent. However, warmer water or shallow water can lead to faster decomposition.
